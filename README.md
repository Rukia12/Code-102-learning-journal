Daily reflections
Thanks to Neil Harris for mentioning code fellows to me
Thank you Capital One for laying us off
It was a rude awakening, but I am grateful that you opened my eyes to code

Code 101 07/30
This is the eve before my Bday
Stoked about learning to code
Been putting this off too long

Had a great experience learning code. Made new friends with Allan and Yams
group bult the website Hitch Hikers guide to Pokemon Go
It was an action packed day
I built the home page 
Thankful I had done a tiny bit of code academy to understand HTML and CSS
Thankful to Stephanie and the super helful teaching assistants
Great teaching style of leading me in the right direction and not giving me an instant answer
I made changes when I got home
forgot to push the new changes to the repository
I just did them on 8/2

Code 102 - Java Script
Oh my Josh! 
It is a whole different language
Makes me wonder where the subtitles are just like when I watch anime in Japanese
On my fist day I was looking around the room for the subtitles. (Just Kidding)
Thank you Craig for explaining things thoroughly. 
Day 1 - went by really fast. Craig was really helpful. Struggled with what to do. I cried for HTML and CSS. I felt a bit insecure because I was the slowest one to finish the units. 
Day 2 - I drank an Americano and stood at the back to keep the brain going. Learned What is a function? what is a var? 
Var tells the computer, get ready to store something. function is action. return -calculate something.
Need to finish the module and create game.
Day 3 - really fast paced. I need to keep up. Feeling Loopy with such an Array of information.
Day 4 - While loops are in my head today, I feel like a java eating zombie
Day 5 - I built a primitive game, my inspiration - tamagochi and my kitty thomas. It did not really integrate everything I tried to absorb but I know I can do this.

I signed up for team treehouse. so far the lectures are giving me the definition of terms I was looking for. suggestion before going in to class 201. learn the basics before you take the class. Craig was awsome, I was just slow because I was unfamiliar.
